## Overview

Creative commands will let you control Krita using natural language instead of hunting through menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts. Just tell the AI what you want, and it happens.

<Note>
  **Status:** Planned for v0.3-0.5 (next 3-6 months)
  
  This feature will work through both text and voice, making it incredibly powerful when combined with voice integration!
</Note>

## How It Works

Instead of navigating menus or memorizing shortcuts, just ask:

```
You: "Lower the opacity to 50%"
AI: ✓ Layer opacity set to 50%

You: "Create a new layer called 'highlights'"
AI: ✓ New layer 'highlights' created

You: "Apply a 5 pixel blur"
AI: ✓ Blur filter applied with 5px radius
```

The AI understands your intent and executes the command in Krita for you.

## Planned Commands

### Layer Management

Control your layers naturally:

```
"Create new layer"
"Duplicate this layer"
"Merge visible layers"
"Delete current layer"
"Rename layer to [name]"
"Move layer up/down"
"Create clipping mask"
"Group selected layers"
"Lock layer transparency"
"Show/hide layer"
```

### Opacity & Blending

Adjust transparency and blend modes:

```
"Set opacity to 75%"
"Lower opacity by 20%"
"Increase opacity"
"Change blend mode to multiply"
"Reset opacity to 100%"
"Make layer more transparent"
```

### Brushes & Tools

Switch tools without searching:

```
"Switch to soft brush"
"Increase brush size"
"Decrease brush size to 30px"
"Change to eraser"
"Activate brush tool"
"Set brush opacity to 50%"
"Change brush to [brush name]"
"Use selection tool"
```

### Filters & Effects

Apply effects through conversation:

```
"Apply blur"
"Apply 10 pixel Gaussian blur"
"Sharpen the layer"
"Add noise"
"Apply levels adjustment"
"Increase contrast"
"Adjust hue by +10"
```

### Canvas Operations

Control your canvas:

```
"Zoom in"
"Zoom out"
"Fit canvas to window"
"Rotate canvas 45 degrees"
"Flip canvas horizontal"
"Reset canvas rotation"
"Create new document 2000x2000"
```

### Color Operations

Work with colors naturally:

```
"Switch foreground and background colors"
"Set color to red"
"Pick color from canvas"
"Adjust saturation"
"Invert colors"
"Fill with foreground color"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Commands

Execute multiple steps at once:

```
You: "Create a new layer called 'shadows', set it to multiply mode, 
     and lower the opacity to 40%"

AI: ✓ Created layer 'shadows'
    ✓ Set blend mode to Multiply
    ✓ Set opacity to 40%
```

### Context-Aware Commands

The AI understands context:

```
You: "This layer is too opaque"
AI: ✓ Reduced opacity to 70%

You: "Still too much"
AI: ✓ Reduced opacity to 50%

You: "Perfect"
AI: Great! Layer opacity is now at 50%
```

### Natural Language Flexibility

Say it however feels natural:

These all do the same thing:
- "Lower the opacity"
- "Make this more transparent"
- "Reduce layer opacity"
- "This layer needs to be lighter"
- "Dial back the opacity a bit"

<Tip>
  The AI understands intent, so you don't need to use exact phrases!

## With Voice Integration

The real magic happens when you combine creative commands with voice:

### Paint Without Interruption

```
🎨 You're painting a portrait...

You (speaking): "Create new layer above this"
AI: ✓ Layer created

You (speaking): "Set it to soft light, 60% opacity"
AI: ✓ Blend mode: Soft Light, Opacity: 60%

You (speaking): "Increase brush size to 100"
AI: ✓ Brush size: 100px

🎨 You never stopped painting...
```

### Quick Adjustments

```
🎨 You're blending colors...

You: "That's too strong, lower it"
AI: ✓ Opacity reduced to 65%

You: "More"
AI: ✓ Opacity reduced to 45%

You: "Good"
```

### Experiment Faster

```
🎨 Testing different effects...

You: "Apply Gaussian blur 10 pixels"
AI: ✓ Blur applied

You: "Undo that"
AI: ✓ Undone

You: "Try motion blur instead"
AI: ✓ Motion blur applied
```

## Safety Features

To prevent accidental destructive commands:

### Confirmation for Destructive Actions

```
You: "Delete all layers"

AI: ⚠️ This will delete all layers. Are you sure?
    Say "confirm" to proceed.

You: "Cancel"

AI: ✓ Action cancelled. No layers deleted.
```

### Undo Support

```
You: "Undo that"
AI: ✓ Last action reversed

You: "Redo"
AI: ✓ Action reapplied
```

### Safe Defaults

- Commands assume safe defaults when parameters aren't specified
- Ambiguous commands prompt for clarification
- Critical actions require explicit confirmation

<Warning>
  While creative commands are powerful, they can't replace knowing how to use Krita manually. Use them to speed up your workflow, not as a substitute for learning the software!
</Warning>

## Technical Limitations

Some things won't be possible:

❌ **Can't Do:**
- Complex custom scripts or macros (yet)
- Paint strokes for you (this is artist-assist, not auto-art)
- Predict what you want without being told
- Access external files or plugins

✅ **Can Do:**
- Execute standard Krita operations
- Adjust settings and properties
- Apply built-in filters and effects
- Manage layers and canvas

## Performance Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Will commands be instant?">
  Most commands execute nearly instantly. Commands that involve AI interpretation (natural language processing) take 1-2 seconds, while direct commands are immediate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does this use API credits?">
  Yes, natural language commands use AI tokens to interpret your intent. Simple, direct commands may be optimized to execute locally without API calls in future versions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use this offline?">
  Not initially, as commands require AI interpretation. A future update may add offline support for common commands.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How This Helps Artists

### Speed Up Your Workflow

Instead of:
1. Finding the layer panel
2. Looking for the opacity slider
3. Adjusting precisely
4. Going back to painting

Just say: "Opacity 50%" and keep painting.

### Reduce Cognitive Load

You're thinking about art, not software:
- ❌ "Was it Ctrl+Shift+N or Ctrl+Alt+N?"
- ✅ "Create new layer"

### Stay in Creative Flow

The fewer interruptions, the better your art:
- No menu hunting
- No shortcut memorization
- No workflow disruption
- Just create

<Tip>
  Creative commands turn Krita into an extension of your thoughts rather than a tool you have to consciously operate!
