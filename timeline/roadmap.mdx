## Training Our Own AI

**Status:** Research & Planning

We're committed to building AI the right way:

### Why Train From Scratch?

- **Custom Architecture** — Optimized for artistic feedback
- **Full Control** — Fine-tune exactly how the AI works
- **Artist-Centric** — Built specifically for digital artists
- **Ethical Foundation** — Consent-based from the ground up

### How It Will Work

<Steps>
<Step title="Artists upload work voluntarily">
  You choose to share your art and get compensated with tokens and badges.
</Step>

<Step title="Manual review process">
  Our team reviews submissions for quality and appropriateness.
</Step>

<Step title="Training with consent">
  Only approved, willingly submitted work is used for training.
</Step>

<Step title="Artist verification">
  Important: We verify artists through official accounts or direct contact to prevent unauthorized use of others' work.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Not Foolproof:** While we'll implement rigorous verification (official account verification, direct artist contact), some unauthorized content may slip through. We're committed to handling reports quickly and fairly.
</Warning>

<Note>
  We can't give exact timelines yet, but this is definitely **not** happening in the near future. This is a 2027+ initiative that requires significant infrastructure and resources.
