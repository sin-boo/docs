## Overview

The Creator Marketplace (planned for mid-2027 to early 2028) will be a platform where artists can contribute to ethical AI training, create custom AI models, and earn revenue from their work.

<Note>
  **Timeline:** Mid-2027 to Early 2028
  
  This is a long-term vision that requires significant infrastructure, legal frameworks, and resources. Details may change as we develop the platform.
</Note>

## Two Sides of the Marketplace

### 1. Contributing to Training (Earn Tokens)

Help build ethical AI by sharing your work:

<Steps>
<Step title="Upload your artwork">
  Voluntarily submit your original artwork to help train AI models
</Step>

<Step title="Verification process">
  We verify you're the actual creator through:
  - Official social media account verification
  - Direct email/contact confirmation
  - Portfolio cross-referencing
  
  <Warning>
  While we'll implement rigorous verification, this system isn't foolproof. Some unauthorized submissions may slip through, but we'll act quickly on reports.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Quality review">
  Our team reviews submissions for:
  - Technical quality
  - Appropriateness
  - Training value
</Step>

<Step title="Earn rewards">
  Approved submissions earn you tokens based on:
  - Image quality (professional-level = ~100 tokens)
  - Quantity contributed
  - Rarity of style/technique
  
  <Check>
  You also earn verification badges that build your reputation!
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Model Marketplace (Buy & Sell)

Create and sell custom AI models trained on ethical datasets:

    Train and sell your own AI models
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Buyers" icon="shopping-cart">
    Purchase unique AI models from artists
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How the Model Marketplace Works

### For Model Creators

Build your own AI model and earn from its use:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your model">
  Using the platform tools, train an AI model on ethically sourced data (consent-based datasets)
</Step>

<Step title="List on marketplace">
  Set your initial price and describe what makes your model unique
</Step>

<Step title="Buyers discover your model">
  Artists browse and purchase your model
</Step>

<Step title="Earn from usage">
  Every time someone uses your model, you earn approximately **30% of the usage cost**
  
  <Note>
  The exact percentage might be adjusted (could be more or less) based on actual server costs and operational expenses. We're aiming for ~30% as a fair split.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

### For Model Buyers

Access unique AI models created by fellow artists:

<Steps>
<Step title="Browse the marketplace">
  Explore AI models created by artists, sorted by style, purpose, and reviews
</Step>

<Step title="One-time purchase">
  Pay an initial price set by the creator
  
  This gets you:
  - Permanent access to the model
  - Initial token allocation for usage
  - No recurring fees
</Step>

<Step title="Use the model">
  Generate feedback, suggestions, or analysis using that specific model
  
  Usage consumes tokens
</Step>

<Step title="Buy more tokens as needed">
  When you run out of tokens, purchase more
  
  No need to repay the initial model price — just pay for usage
</Step>
</Steps>

## Pricing Model (Tentative)

<Warning>
  These are preliminary ideas. Final pricing will be determined based on actual operational costs and community feedback.
</Warning>

### Initial Purchase
- **One-time fee** set by model creator (e.g., $5-$50)
- Includes token bundle (e.g., 1000-5000 tokens depending on price)
- Lifetime access to the model

### Ongoing Usage
- Pay only for tokens you consume
- No subscription or recurring model fees
- Transparent token costs

### Revenue Split (Approximate)

When someone uses a purchased model:
- **~30%** goes to the model creator
- **~70%** covers server costs, AI processing, platform maintenance

<Tip>
  The goal is sustainable revenue for creators while covering the significant costs of running AI inference on our servers.
</Tip>

## Badge & Reputation System

Build your standing in the community:

### Contribution Badges

Earn badges by contributing training data:
- 🥉 **Contributor** — First 10 approved submissions
- 🥈 **Supporter** — 50+ approved submissions
- 🥇 **Champion** — 100+ approved submissions
- 💎 **Legend** — 500+ high-quality submissions

### Creator Badges

Earn badges as a model creator:
- ⭐ **Emerging Creator** — First model published
- 🌟 **Established Creator** — 5+ models with good reviews
- ✨ **Top Creator** — Models with 100+ buyers
- 🏆 **Master Creator** — Consistent 5-star rated models

### Benefits of High Reputation
- Featured placement in marketplace
- Higher trust from buyers
- Potential for platform partnerships
- Community recognition

## Ethical AI Training

Why this approach is different:

### Consent-First

Unlike many AI companies:
- ❌ **Others:** Scrape art without permission
- ✅ **Neutral Art:** Only use voluntarily submitted work with explicit consent

### Artist Verification

We take steps to ensure submissions are legitimate:

1. **Official Account Verification** — Link your verified social media
2. **Direct Contact** — We may reach out to confirm large submissions
3. **Portfolio Cross-Reference** — Compare against known work
4. **Community Reports** — Quick action on suspected theft

<Warning>
  **Important Disclaimer:** Despite our best efforts, this system cannot be 100% foolproof. Some unauthorized content may occasionally slip through verification. We're committed to:
  - Acting quickly on reports
  - Removing unauthorized content immediately
  - Banning users who abuse the system
  - Continuously improving verification methods
</Warning>

### Transparency

You'll always know:
- What your art is being used for
- How many tokens you've earned
- Which models used your contributions
- Your impact on AI training

## Training Our Own AI (Long-Term)

Eventually, we plan to train AI models from scratch:

### Why Our Own AI?

- **Custom Architecture** — Optimized specifically for artistic feedback
- **Full Control** — Fine-tune behavior and outputs precisely
- **Artist-Centric Design** — Built for digital artists' needs
- **Ethical Foundation** — Consent-based from day one

### The Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Collect consent-based dataset">
  Artists voluntarily submit work through the marketplace
</Step>

<Step title="Manual curation">
  Human reviewers ensure quality and appropriateness
</Step>

<Step title="Train custom models">
  Use our own architecture designed for artistic analysis
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to platform">
  Make ethically-trained models available to all users
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Training AI from scratch is expensive and time-intensive. This is definitely a **2027+ initiative** that requires substantial funding and infrastructure.
</Note>

## Questions & Concerns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What if someone steals my art and uploads it?">
  Report it immediately. We'll investigate and remove unauthorized content. Repeat offenders will be permanently banned. While we can't catch everything automatically, we take theft seriously and act quickly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remove my submissions later?">
  Yes. You can request removal of your contributions. However, models already trained on your work cannot be "untrained" — only future training will exclude your work.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do you prevent AI-generated art submissions?">
  We use a combination of automated detection and manual review. AI-generated art will not be accepted for training datasets, as we want genuine human creativity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What styles/types of art are accepted?">
  All professional-quality digital art: illustration, concept art, character design, environment art, abstract, etc. Content must be appropriate (no hate symbols, explicit content, etc.).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will this training data be sold or shared?">
  **Never.** Your submissions are used exclusively for Neutral Art's own AI models. We will never sell the dataset or share it with third parties.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
