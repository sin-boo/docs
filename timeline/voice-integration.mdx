## Overview

Voice integration will let you interact with your AI assistant completely hands-free, so you can keep both hands on your drawing tablet while getting feedback and advice.

<Note>
  **Status:** Planned for v0.3-0.5 (next 3-6 months)
  
  The voice technology has already been tested in other projects and works well — it just needs to be integrated into Neutral Art!
</Note>

## Planned Features

### Text-to-Speech (AI Reads to You)

The AI will read its responses aloud so you don't have to stop painting to read:

- 🎤 **Natural Voice** — Clear, easy-to-understand speech
- 🎚️ **Volume Control** — Adjust to your preference
- ⏸️ **Pause/Resume** — Control playback as needed
- 🔇 **Mute Option** — Toggle voice on/off quickly

<Tip>
  Perfect for getting feedback while you're in the zone — no need to look away from your canvas!
</Tip>

### Voice Input (You Talk to AI)

Speak naturally to your AI assistant:

- 🗣️ **Conversational Input** — Just talk like you would to a person
- 🎙️ **Push-to-Talk** — Hold a key to speak (won't pick up background noise)
- 📝 **Automatic Transcription** — Your words appear as text in the chat
- 🌐 **Multiple Languages** — Support for various languages planned

### Hands-Free Workflow

The complete hands-free experience:

- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Quick toggle for voice input
- 🎨 **Paint While Talking** — Keep working while asking questions
- 🔄 **Continuous Conversation** — Natural back-and-forth dialogue
- 🚫 **Background Noise Filtering** — Focuses on your voice

## Use Cases

### Getting Real-Time Feedback

```
You: "Hey, I'm working on the lighting for this portrait. 
     Does the rim light on the left feel too strong?"

AI: "The rim light intensity looks good, but consider softening 
    the edge where it meets the shadow. You might also want to 
    add a subtle fill light on the shadow side to maintain 
    facial structure."

You: "How do I soften that edge in Krita?"

AI: "Use a soft round brush with low opacity, set to blend mode. 
    Gently brush along the edge to create a gradual transition..."
```

### Learning While You Work

```
You: "Remind me, what's the rule for color temperature in shadows?"

AI: "Shadows are typically cooler than lit areas. If your light 
    source is warm (like sunlight), your shadows should lean 
    toward cool colors like blues and purples. This creates 
    visual depth and atmospheric perspective."

You: "Got it, thanks!"
```

### Quick Questions

```
You: "What's the shortcut for merging layers?"

AI: "Control+E merges the current layer with the layer below it."

You: "Perfect!"
```

## Technical Details

### How It Will Work

<Steps>
<Step title="Activate voice input">
  Press and hold your configured hotkey (or use a toolbar button)
</Step>

<Step title="Speak your question">

  <Check>
  You'll see your words appear in the chat as you speak
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="AI responds">
  The response appears in chat AND is read aloud automatically
</Step>

<Step title="Continue painting">
  Listen to the advice while your hands stay on your tablet
</Step>
</Steps>

### Privacy & Processing

- 🔒 **Your Choice** — Voice processing happens through your AI provider (Google, OpenAI, etc.)
- 🎙️ **Local First** — Audio isn't stored unless you choose to save conversations
- ⏱️ **Real-Time** — Speech-to-text happens quickly for natural conversation
- 🔐 **Secure** — Same security as text-based chat

<Warning>
  Using voice features will consume additional tokens/credits from your AI provider, as voice-to-text processing is separate from text generation.
</Warning>

## Configuration Options

When voice integration launches, you'll be able to customize:

### Voice Settings
- **Voice selection** — Choose from available voice options
- **Speech speed** — Slower or faster reading
- **Volume level** — Adjust independently from system volume
- **Auto-read** — Toggle automatic reading of responses

### Input Settings
- **Activation method** — Push-to-talk vs toggle
- **Hotkey binding** — Choose your preferred key
- **Noise threshold** — Sensitivity for voice detection
- **Language** — Set your preferred language for transcription

### Workflow Settings
- **Visual feedback** — Show when listening/transcribing
- **Confirmation beep** — Audio cue when voice is active
- **Auto-pause** — Stop playback when you start talking

## Why This Matters for Artists

Traditional workflows interrupt your creative flow:

❌ **Without Voice:**
1. Notice something wrong
2. Put down stylus
3. Type question
4. Read response
5. Pick up stylus
6. Try to remember what AI said
7. Continue painting

✅ **With Voice:**
1. Notice something wrong
2. Ask while painting
3. Keep painting while listening
4. Apply advice immediately

<Tip>
  Voice integration keeps you in the creative flow state, which is when your best work happens!
</Tip>
