## Overview

Neutral Art is built on top of Krita using the Krita Builder tool. This allows you to create your own custom versions with additional features, modifications, or integrations.

<Note>
  **Important:** Building Neutral Art requires technical knowledge and access to the Krita source code. This is for advanced users who want to contribute to development or create custom builds.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you start building Neutral Art, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Krita Source Code** — Access to the official Krita repository
- ✅ **Krita Builder** — The build tool for creating custom Krita versions
- ✅ **Development Environment** — Compiler tools, Qt libraries, and dependencies
- ✅ **Git** — For managing source code
- ✅ **CMake** — Build system used by Krita

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone Krita Source">
    Get the official Krita source code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita.git
    cd krita
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Krita Builder">
    Download and configure the Krita Builder tool:

    ```bash
    # Clone the Krita Builder
    git clone https://invent.kde.org/sdk/krita-builder.git
    cd krita-builder

    # Install dependencies (varies by OS)
    # Follow the setup instructions for your platform
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Neutral Art Modifications">
    This is where you'd apply the Neutral Art-specific changes to the Krita source code. These include:

    - AI assistant integration
    - API key management
    - Visual feedback system
    - Canvas/layer sending functionality

    <Warning>
      The specific modifications are part of the Neutral Art development process and require coordination with the development team.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Building Process

Once you have the source code and modifications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Build">
    Use Krita Builder to configure your build:

    ```bash
    # Run the build configuration
    python3 krita-builder.py --configure
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Neutral Art">
    Compile the modified Krita version:

    ```bash
    # Build the application
    python3 krita-builder.py --build
    ```

    This may take significant time depending on your system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Build">
    Launch and test your custom Neutral Art build:

    ```bash
    # Run the built application
    python3 krita-builder.py --run
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
