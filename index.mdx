## What is Neutral Art

Welcome to **Neutral Art**, a reimagined version of Krita — built from the official Krita source using the Krita Builder.  
This project isn’t an AI art generator or a replacement for artists. Instead, it’s a creative assistant designed to **help artists create better art, faster**, while preserving their artistic identity.

Neutral Art is still in its early stages — a foundation for what will become a powerful companion for digital artists.  
You can already connect to AI services like **Google Studio / Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **OpenRouter**, and send your artwork to receive **feedback, suggestions, and creative critiques**. The goal is to help you *improve your technique*, not automate it away.

Future updates will expand this foundation to include:
- **Voice integration** — text-to-speech and transcription, allowing you to talk to your assistant hands-free.  
- **Creative commands** — like “lower opacity,” “create new layer,” or “apply blur” directly through chat.  
- **Ethically sourced AI models** — trained on consent-based datasets.  
- **A creator marketplace** (planned for 2027–2028), where artists can sell their own AI-enhanced models or plugins and earn a fair share of the revenue (around 30%).
