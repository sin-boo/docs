## What is Neutral Art

Welcome to **Neutral Art**, a custom build of Krita created using the Krita Builder. This project was born from a simple belief: **artists shouldn't be replaced by AI — they should be empowered by it.**

Neutral Art is **not** an AI image generator, and it's **not** meant to replace artists. Instead, it's a creative companion designed to **help artists make better art, faster**, giving you the tools to stay competitive while preserving your artistic identity and craft.

This is an early version — the foundation of what will become a comprehensive creative assistant. Right now, you can:

- Connect to AI services: **Google Studio / Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **OpenRouter**
- Send your artwork to receive **feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism**
- Ask questions about Krita features and techniques
- Get help improving your artistic technique

## Why Neutral Art Exists

I created Neutral Art because I believe artists need tools like this to thrive in an AI-driven world. This isn't about automating creativity — it's about giving artists a companion that helps them work smarter, learn faster, and stay ahead.

## What's Coming Next

Future updates will expand on this foundation:

- **Voice integration** — text-to-speech and transcription for hands-free interaction with your creative assistant
- **Creative commands** — direct control like "lower opacity," "create new layer," or "apply blur" through chat
- **Patreon subscription** — access to multiple AI models without being restricted to just three providers
- **Ethically sourced AI models** — trained on consent-based datasets that respect artists' rights
- **Creator marketplace** (planned for mid-2027 to early 2028) — where artists can create and sell their own AI-enhanced models or plugins, earning approximately 30% of usage revenue (the rest covers the significant costs of AI generation)
