## What is Neutral Art

Welcome to **Neutral Art**, a custom build of Krita created using the Krita Builder. This project was born from a simple belief: **artists shouldn't be replaced by AI — they should be empowered by it.**

Neutral Art is **not** an AI image generator, and it's **not** meant to replace artists. Instead, it's a creative companion designed to **help artists make better art, faster**, giving you the tools to stay competitive while preserving your artistic identity and craft.

This is an early version — the foundation of what will become a comprehensive creative assistant. Right now, you can:

- Connect to AI services: **Google Studio / Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **OpenRouter**
- Send your artwork to receive **feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism**
- Ask questions about Krita features and techniques
- Get help improving your artistic technique

## Why Neutral Art Exists

I created Neutral Art because I believe artists need tools like this to thrive in an AI-driven world. This isn't about automating creativity — it's about giving artists a companion that helps them work smarter, learn faster, and stay ahead.

## Support the Project

Neutral Art is a passion project built to empower artists. To continue development and bring exciting features like the Patreon subscription service, voice integration, and the creator marketplace to life, we need your support.

### Funding Goals

Running AI services and developing new features requires resources. Here's what your support helps with:

- **Server costs** — Hosting AI models and running the infrastructure for the Patreon subscription service
- **Development time** — Building new features like voice integration, creative commands, and the creator marketplace
- **Ethical AI training** — Sourcing and training AI models on consent-based datasets that respect artists' rights
- **Community features** — Creating a platform where artists can share, sell, and benefit from AI tools

  Help fund development and bring new features to life faster. Every contribution helps keep Neutral Art free and accessible to artists who need it most.

## What's Coming Next

Future updates will expand on this foundation:

- **Voice integration** — text-to-speech for hands-free interaction with your creative assistant
- **Patreon subscription** — access to multiple AI models without being restricted to just three providers
- **Ethically sourced AI models** — trained on consent-based datasets that respect artists' rights
- **Creator marketplace** (planned for mid-2027 to early 2028) — where artists can create and sell their own AI-enhanced models or plugins, earning approximately 30% of usage revenue (the rest covers the significant costs of AI generation)
