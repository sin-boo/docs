## Overview

One of Neutral Art's core features is getting AI-powered feedback on your artwork to help you improve your skills and technique.

<Note>
  **Coming in the next release:** The ability to send your canvas/artwork directly to the AI for visual analysis is currently in development. This guide will be updated once that feature is available.
</Note>

## Current Capabilities

Right now, you can get valuable feedback by:

### Describing Your Artwork

Talk to the AI about your work in progress:
- Describe your composition and get feedback
- Explain what you're trying to achieve
- Ask about specific techniques you're using
- Discuss color choices and lighting decisions

<Tip>
  Be specific! Instead of "How's my painting?", try "I'm working on a portrait with backlighting. How can I make the rim light more convincing?"
</Tip>

### Asking Technical Questions

Get help with Krita-specific techniques:
- "How do I create a soft gradient in Krita?"
- "What brush settings are best for painting hair?"
- "How can I fix muddy colors in my painting?"
- "What's the best way to blend in Krita?"

### Learning Art Fundamentals

Use the AI as your art instructor:
- Color theory and harmony
- Composition principles
- Lighting and values
- Anatomy and proportions
- Perspective and depth

## Types of Feedback You Can Request

### Composition Analysis
- Balance and visual flow
- Focal points and emphasis
- Rule of thirds and golden ratio
- Negative space usage

### Color Critique
- Color harmony and palette choices
- Value structure and contrast
- Color temperature and mood
- Saturation and intensity

### Technical Feedback
- Brush technique and execution
- Edge control (hard vs soft)
- Texture and detail work
- Layer management tips

### Conceptual Guidance
- Storytelling and narrative
- Mood and atmosphere
- Style consistency
- Reference gathering suggestions

## Making the Most of AI Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Set the right personality">
  Choose a personality that matches your needs. Use "Critical" when you want honest improvement tips, or "Encouraging" when you need motivation.
</Step>

<Step title="Be specific about your goals">
  Tell the AI what you're trying to achieve. "I want this portrait to feel warm and inviting" gives better feedback than "critique my portrait."
</Step>

<Step title="Ask follow-up questions">
  Don't hesitate to dig deeper! Ask "why" and "how" to understand the reasoning behind suggestions.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply and iterate">
  Make changes based on feedback, then ask again. This iterative process is how you improve fastest.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Conversations

### Getting Composition Help

```
You: I'm working on a landscape with mountains in the background and a lake 
in the foreground. The composition feels boring. Any suggestions?

AI: Let's make your composition more dynamic! Consider:
- Adding a foreground element (rocks, trees) to create depth
- Placing the horizon off-center using the rule of thirds
- Adding a leading line (path, river) to guide the eye
- Including some mid-ground elements to bridge foreground and background
```

### Color Theory Question

```
You: My sunset painting looks muddy. I'm using orange, purple, and yellow 
but it's not working. What am I doing wrong?

AI: Muddy colors often come from:
- Mixing too many colors together
- Not having clear value separation
- Over-saturating everything equally

Try this: Keep your oranges/yellows bright near the sun, but desaturate 
the purples as they move away. Also ensure your values have clear light/mid/dark separation.
```

<Warning>
  Remember: AI feedback is a tool, not a replacement for developing your own artistic judgment. Use it to learn and grow, but trust your artistic vision!
</Warning>

## Limitations

Be aware that the AI:
- Cannot see your artwork yet (coming in next release)
- Provides general advice that may not fit every style
- Doesn't understand your full artistic vision
- May suggest changes you disagree with — and that's okay!

<Tip>
  Take what's helpful and leave what isn't. You're the artist — the AI is just here to help you grow!
