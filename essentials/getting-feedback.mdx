## Sending Your Artwork for Feedback

### How to Send Canvas/Layers

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your artwork">
  Create or open the artwork you want feedback on in Neutral Art
</Step>

<Step title="Select what to send">
  You can send:
  - Your entire canvas
  - A specific layer (select it first)
  
  <Tip>
  Sending individual layers is great for getting focused feedback on specific elements!
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Send to AI">
  In the AI assistant panel, click the button to send your canvas/layer to the AI
</Step>

<Step title="Receive visual analysis">
  The AI will analyze your artwork and provide feedback on:
  - Composition and layout
  - Color harmony and values
  - Lighting and shadows
  - Technical execution
  - Areas for improvement
</Step>
</Steps>

## Getting the Most Detailed Feedback

Right now, you can also get valuable feedback by:

### Describing Your Artwork

Talk to the AI about your work in progress:
- Describe your composition and get feedback
- Explain what you're trying to achieve
- Ask about specific techniques you're using
- Discuss color choices and lighting decisions

<Tip>
  Be specific! Instead of "How's my painting?", try "I'm working on a portrait with backlighting. How can I make the rim light more convincing?"
</Tip>

### Asking Technical Questions

Get help with Krita-specific techniques:
- "How do I create a soft gradient in Krita?"
- "What brush settings are best for painting hair?"
- "How can I fix muddy colors in my painting?"
- "What's the best way to blend in Krita?"

### Learning Art Fundamentals

Use the AI as your art instructor:
- Color theory and harmony
- Composition principles
- Lighting and values
- Anatomy and proportions
- Perspective and depth

## Making the Most of AI Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Set the right personality">
  Choose a personality that matches your needs. Use "Critical" when you want honest improvement tips, or "Encouraging" when you need motivation.
</Step>

<Step title="Be specific about your goals">
  Tell the AI what you're trying to achieve. "I want this portrait to feel warm and inviting" gives better feedback than "critique my portrait."
</Step>

<Step title="Ask follow-up questions">
  Don't hesitate to dig deeper! Ask "why" and "how" to understand the reasoning behind suggestions.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply and iterate">
  Make changes based on feedback, then ask again. This iterative process is how you improve fastest.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Conversations

### Getting Composition Help

```
You: I'm working on a landscape with mountains in the background and a lake 
in the foreground. The composition feels boring. Any suggestions?

AI: Let's make your composition more dynamic! Consider:
- Adding a foreground element (rocks, trees) to create depth
- Placing the horizon off-center using the rule of thirds
- Adding a leading line (path, river) to guide the eye
- Including some mid-ground elements to bridge foreground and background
```

### Color Theory Question

```
You: My sunset painting looks muddy. I'm using orange, purple, and yellow 
but it's not working. What am I doing wrong?

AI: Muddy colors often come from:
- Mixing too many colors together
- Not having clear value separation
- Over-saturating everything equally

Try this: Keep your oranges/yellows bright near the sun, but desaturate 
the purples as they move away. Also ensure your values have clear light/mid/dark separation.
```

<Warning>
  Remember: AI feedback is a tool, not a replacement for developing your own artistic judgment. Use it to learn and grow, but trust your artistic vision!
</Warning>

## Limitations

Be aware that the AI:
- Cannot see your artwork yet (coming in next release)
- Provides general advice that may not fit every style
- Doesn't understand your full artistic vision
- May suggest changes you disagree with — and that's okay!

<Tip>
  Take what's helpful and leave what isn't. You're the artist — the AI is just here to help you grow!
</Tip>
