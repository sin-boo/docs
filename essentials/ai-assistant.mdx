## Setting Up AI Providers

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose your AI provider">
  Select from the dropdown: **Google Studio**, **OpenAI**, or **OpenRouter**.

  - **Google Studio** — Free tier available, good for general art feedback

  - **OpenRouter** — Access multiple models through one API (coming with Patreon)
</Step>

<Step title="Get your API key">
  **For Google Studio:**
  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and create a free API key.

  **For OpenAI:**
  Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key.

  **For OpenRouter:**
  API keys provided through Patreon subscription (coming soon).
</Step>

<Step title="Enter and save your API key">
  Paste your API key into the input field and click **"Save Key"**.

  <Check>
  The AI assistant will automatically detect your provider and fetch available models.

  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Conversation Management

Keep track of your creative discussions with persistent conversation history:

- **Conversation Selector** — Switch between past conversations
- **New Conversation** — Start fresh discussions with different models
- **Delete Conversations** — Clean up old conversations you no longer need
- **Automatic Titles** — Conversations are automatically titled from your first message

<Tip>
  Each conversation remembers which AI model and provider you were using, so you can continue discussions seamlessly.
</Tip>

## Voice Input & Transcription

Talk to your AI assistant hands-free using advanced speech-to-text technology:

### How It Works
- **Record Button** — Click and hold to record your voice
- **Automatic Transcription** — Your speech is converted to text using Whisper AI
- **Review & Edit** — Check the transcribed text before sending
- **GPU Acceleration** — Uses NVIDIA/AMD GPUs when available for faster processing

### Voice Settings
- **Backend Selection** — Choose CPU, NVIDIA GPU, or AMD GPU processing
- **Microphone Selection** — Pick your preferred audio input device
- **Status Display** — See recording and processing status in real-time

<Tip>
  Voice input works best in quiet environments. The AI will automatically detect when you're done speaking.
</Tip>

## Image Integration

Get visual feedback by sending your artwork directly to the AI:

### Canvas Options
- **Whole Image** — Send your entire canvas as it appears
- **AI Visible Layers** — Send only layers marked as AI-visible
- **Automatic Resizing** — Large images are optimized for API limits
- **Multiple Formats** — Works with all Krita-supported image types

### When to Send Images
- **Composition Feedback** — Get advice on layout and balance
- **Color Analysis** — Understand color harmony and values
- **Technique Critique** — Receive detailed feedback on your methods
- **Style Assessment** — Discuss artistic choices and approaches

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Operating System** — Windows 10 or later
- **RAM** — 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended for voice transcription
- **Storage** — 500MB free space for models and conversation data

### GPU Acceleration (Optional)
- **NVIDIA GPUs** — CUDA-compatible cards for faster voice transcription
- **AMD GPUs** — DirectML-compatible cards (limited support)
- **CPU Fallback** — Works on any modern CPU if no GPU available

### Network Requirements
- **Internet Connection** — Required for AI API communication
- **API Access** — Valid API keys for your chosen provider
- **No VPN Restrictions** — Some providers may block VPN connections

<Warning>
  **API Costs:** Each provider has different pricing. Google Studio offers a free tier, while OpenAI charges per token used. Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
</Warning>

## Privacy & Security

Your data security is our priority:

### Local Storage Only
- **API Keys** — Encrypted using Windows Data Protection API
- **Conversations** — Stored locally in JSON format
- **No External Servers** — We never see your API keys or conversations

### Direct API Communication
- **Peer-to-Peer** — Communication goes directly from your computer to AI providers
- **No Intermediaries** — Your data never passes through our servers
- **Provider Policies** — Each AI provider has its own data retention policies

<Tip>
  Switch between providers anytime — your API keys and conversations are stored separately for each provider.
</Tip>
